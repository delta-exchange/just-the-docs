# Order Types

We currently support three types of order:

  -   **Limit order:** is an order to buy or sell a specified number of derivative contracts at a specified price. A limit order will only ever fill at the specified price or better price.
    
-   **Market order:** is an order to buy or sell a specified number of derivative contracts at the best available price available in the order book. There is no guarantee that a market order will fill at the price specified. A market order may fill at a number of different prices, based on the quantity of the market order and the quantities of the existing orders on the order book at the time.
- **Stop order:** is an order which is triggered at a stop price provided by the user.
