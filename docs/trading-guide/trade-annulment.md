# Trade Annulment & Unfair Trading Practices

On rare occasions, to preserve market integrity, Delta Exchange reserves the right to annul trades that were erroneous or were done on account of fraud or market manipulation, or which occured in abnormal non-orderly market where there is high likelihood that one side of the trade has been done unwillingly. 

**Mis-trade rules that apply to all contracts**
1. Trades executed far away from prevailing market price: Trades that are executed at prices far away from the prevailing market price (as measured by the underlying's price and the contract's fair mark price) due to volatile market conditions or intentional market manipulation will be treated as mis-trades and are liable to be annuled. 

2. Trades in which one trader or a group of colluding traders manipulate trading in thinly liquid order boooks to create price action resulting in abnormal profits for the traders will be treated as mis-trades and are liable to be annuled.


**Mis-trade rules that apply to options contracts**

Any options trade that happends more than 20% away from the theoretical price of the options contract is liable for being considered as mispriced. If the execution price of your options trade is mispriced, you should send an email to support@delta.exchange as soon as possible. Delta Exchange will conduct an investigation and will annul the trades in questions if it is clearly established that the trades hapened in abnormal and exceptional circumstances and one side of the trade was done unwillingly. In such situations, the profits made by the winning trader will be clawed back to make the losing side whole.
