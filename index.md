# Getting Started

 Delta Exchange is a pltform for trading of cryptocurrency derivatives. We currently offer Futures contracts on bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), ripple (XRP) and stellar lumens (XLM). The following features stand us apart from other cryptocurrency exchanges:

- **Leverage:** All derivative contracts traded on Delta Exchange have built in leverage of up to $$100$$x. This means that with say 1 BTC, you can take a position of up to 100 BTC.
    
- **Speculate or manage risk:** Our futures contracts can be used to trade both rising markets (by going long) and falling markets (by going short) profitably or to hedge price risk.
    
- **Cryptocurrency settlement:** Fiat currencies (e.g. US Dollar) are not supported on Delta. This means that all the calculations of trade profit/ loss as well as trade settlement in done in cryptocurrency terms. Currently we have two types of contracts: 
	- **bitcoin settled futures contracts:** these futures contracts are margined and settled in bitcoin. Hence, to trade these contracts you need to have bitcoins.
	- **stablecoin settled futures contracts:** these futures contract are margined and settled in USDC. USDC is a stablecoin whose value is pegged to the US Dollar. To trade USDC settled futures, you need to have USDC.
    
Once you have created your account, you need to fund your Delta Exhange wallet with bitcoins (BTC).

 
### **Making your first trade on Delta**

The trading dashboard of Delta Exchange is comprised of multiple panels. These include chart, order book/ recent trades, order submission and open orders & position panels. The functions and uses of these panels are delineated in the picture below.

To place a trade, you need to:

-   Select the contract you are interested in

-   Recall that futures contracts on Delta Exchange are margined and settled in either BTC or USDC. If you are looking to trade a USDC settled contract, you could use the currency converter tool to change BTC to USDC.
    
-   Specify the number of contracts that you are looking to buy/ sell
    
-   Decide on the order type (e.g. limit or market) and place it

 Once an order is placed, it will immediately show up in ‘Open Orders’ tab in the Balances panel. On execution of the order you acquire a new ‘Open position’ which displayed in the Balances panel.

 Trading derivatives is more involved and quite different from spot buying and selling of cryptocurrencies. The mechanics of margining, calculation of PnL, details of contract settlement may not be always obvious and we’d encourage you to browse through the Tutorials section as well as the rest of the documentation.

  We hope you have a happy and profitable trading experience on Delta Exchange!
